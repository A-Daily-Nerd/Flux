# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Flux!

How to contribute

- Open an issue to discuss features or bugs before large changes.
- Fork the repository and create a topic branch for your work.
- Run the build locally and add tests for bug fixes or features when possible.
- Send a pull request describing your changes; include before/after examples.

Coding style

- Java source is in `src/` — follow the existing formatting and minimal, focused changes.
- Keep changes small and add tests or example `.flx` files in the repo when adding language features.

PR process

- CI will compile the project and run a smoke check on `test.flx`.
- Maintainers will review and request changes if needed.
